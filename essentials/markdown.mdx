### Subscription

1. Go Subscription tab on your AppStore Connect account of your app. You will see it on left menu.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/in-app.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/in-app.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

2. Create Subscription Group.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/group.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/group.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

3. Create Subscription. For every Subscription (Weekly,Monthly,Yearly) we want to have seperate item. 
For id of subscription we are recommended to use such formula "yourApp_duration_price"
For ex. "wally_1w_299"
This is unique id which we will use then on RevenueCat Dashboard and in our app directly. So i recommend to think about it and save it.

  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/subscription.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

4. On Subscription page we are filling data about Subscription as Duration, Localization, Pricing and Screenshot of paywall. It is needed for easier review of your app. I believe sometimes reviewer does not look directly to your paywall in app, he just looks at your screenshot, so do not forget to upgrade it, when you change paywall.

ðŸ’¡ Do not forget to add "Restore" button on your paywall, it is common reject from Apple.

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/sub-inner.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"

5. Create App on RevenueCat console
Here we will need walk through flow.

<img

  src="/images/rev-app.png"
  alt="Hero Light"

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/rev-app.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

6. Get Shared App Secret from AppStore Connect

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/secret-app.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/secret-app.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

7. Get In App Key from Integrations Tab in AppStore Connect

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/in-app-key.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/in-app-key.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"

8. Add Your Products. Id should be exactly as it is on AppStore side.
