## Android Specific Setup

Update your AndroidManifest.xml 
Add your AdMob App ID to your app's AndroidManifest.xml file by adding the 'meta-data' tag shown below. You can find your App ID in the AdMob UI. For android:value insert your own AdMob App ID in quotes, as shown below.

You can use these test App ID's from Admob for development:

```dart
android: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713
iOS: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511
```


```xml AndroidManifest.xml
<manifest>
  <application>
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
      android:value="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713"/>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

## iOS Specific Setup

Update your Info.plist per [Firebase instructions](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/quick-start#update_your_infoplist).

```plist Info.plist
<key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
<string>ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~1458002511</string>
```
and add

```plist Info.plist
<key>io.flutter.embedded_views_preview</key>
<true/>
```

## Creating AdUnits

The kind of advertisement presented is determined by the ad unit. You should create ad units for each type of ad that you plan to have in your app.

Hereâ€™s how you do it:
1. Click Apps on the left-side menu and then select your app
2. Click the ADD AD UNIT button
3. Select the type of ad (e.g Banner)
4. Enter the Ad unit name, click Create ad unit, and then select Done
5. Similarly, create an ad unit for the Interstitial and Rewarded ads. While creating the rewarded ads, be sure to keep the default settings
6. Finally, create Ad units for the iOS app as well

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/create-ad.gif"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/create-ad.gif"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
