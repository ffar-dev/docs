## Setting up

FlutterPlate is Starter Kit to start your new App. It has Preconfigured integrations, but there are still things you should do on your side of account. For Example create In App Subscriptions or Banner item in Admob account. You can refer to this documentation while doing it. And don't forget, you can contact me support@flutterplate.dev if you have troubles.



## Make it yours

FLutterPlate is planned to reduce time and nerves people spend on every launch. It can be hard on first sight, and it can be difficult, but from second app you should be ⚡️.
