## Setup your development

First of all clone repository of FlutterPlate
It will be start of every project

### What you need, and what do not

FlutterPlate works with 3 types of data. REST, Sqlite(Moor) and Firestore. Definetely, you will not need all of them in one app. You may also need RevenueCat, but you don't need Admob.
We should get rid of unneeded dependencies. Just remove them from pubspec.yaml file. Your editor will help you to remove dead code with help of error. If you did everything right app will still work without unneded dependencies.

### Integrations

Documentation will show how to integrate every feature which need work on your account also. If you are ready, proceed directly to section.
